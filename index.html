                <p>I am a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Florida with a strong interest in design, robotics, and problem-solving. My education has given me a solid foundation in key engineering principles such as Computer-Aided Design, Mechanics of Materials, and Thermodynamics. I am passionate about using my technical skills to create innovative solutions and improve mechanical systems.

                    I have hands-on experience in designing and building systems, collaborating on projects in both academic and competition environments. I enjoy working in teams and am always eager to learn new skills that will help me grow as an engineer. With a focus on precision and functionality, I aim to contribute meaningfully to any project I am part of.

                            <p>From a young age, I have been fascinated by how things work, particularly in the fields of mechanics and technology. My curiosity grew as I started engaging in hands-on projects, whether it was building small models or tinkering with household items. This early exposure to problem-solving and design sparked my passion for engineering, and I knew that I wanted to pursue this field professionally.</p>

                            <h3>University</h3>
                            <p>In August 2022, I began my Mechanical Engineering degree at the University of Florida. This marked the formal start of my engineering education, where I dove into a rigorous curriculum that included courses such as Computer-Aided Graphics and Design, Mechanics of Materials, and Thermodynamics. These courses provided me with a strong technical foundation, and I became increasingly interested in the application of engineering to solve real-world problems.</p>

                            <h3>Research Intern</h3>
                            <p>During my time at UF, I sought opportunities to gain hands-on experience. I worked as a designer for the GATR Vex Robotics team, where I helped build robots for competition and performed FEA analysis to optimize their chassis. I also became a research intern at the Machine Intelligence Laboratory, where I contributed to the development of autonomous underwater vehicles for the RoboSub competition. These experiences deepened my knowledge and equipped me with practical skills in design, rapid prototyping, and collaboration.</p>
